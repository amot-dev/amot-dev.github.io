# amot.dev

My personal website. Check it out at [amot.dev](http://amot.dev)!

## Setup

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build

To compile the React code, use the provided script:

```bash
./babel.sh
```

This command transpiles `src/script.js` to `script.js` using Babel.

## Running Locally

You can serve the website locally using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
