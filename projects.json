It allows you to rate routes on key criteria like scenery, road quality, and twistiness. Or, for the offroad enthusiasts, you can rate them on surface consistency, technicality, and general flow.\\n\\nStarted as a simple hobby project for me to keep track of my own favourite motorcycle roads, I quickly realized that beyond forums and some curated print media, there isn't a great place for motorcylists to share the hidden gems around them. So, I made it.\\n\\nMotoTwist has support for multiple users, search and filters to help users discover great roads, and new features are (as of now) constantly being added. Anyone can deploy an instance within minutes via Docker, and plans are underway for a central deployment.",

Of course, this is all still in development, but the idea is to diversify some of the tools and armour with some special abilities, making different sets better for different tasks.\\n\\nFor example, Ender gear is best suited for exploration, Netherite is best for combat, and Sculk is best for mining. The final Nightmare tier will be a jack of all trades, but master of none.
