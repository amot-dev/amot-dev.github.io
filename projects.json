		"MotoTwist is a self-hosted, containerized service to track and rate motorcycle roads. It allows you to rate routes on key criteria like scenery, road quality, and twistiness. Or, for the offroad enthusiasts, you can rate them on surface consistency, technicality, and general flow.\\n\\nStarted as a simple hobby project for me to keep track of my own favourite motorcycle roads, I quickly realized that beyond forums and some curated print media, there isn't a great place for motorcylists to share the hidden gems around them. So, I made it.\\n\\nMotoTwist has support for multiple users, search and filters to help users discover great roads, and new features are (as of now) constantly being added. Anyone can deploy an instance within minutes via Docker, and plans are underway for a central deployment."

		"Endshards is a Minecraft Mod intended to overhaul the endgame progression with by upgrading the existing Netherite gear, and by adding 3 new sets of gear, a new dimension, and a new boss. Of course, this is all still in development, but the idea is to diversify some of the tools and armour with some special abilities, making different sets better for different tasks.\\n\\nFor example, Ender gear is best suited for exploration, Netherite is best for combat, and Sculk is best for mining. The final Nightmare tier will be a jack of all trades, but master of none. This project was initially intended for me to learn Minecraft modding, but that turned out to be fairly simple so I expanded my goals. For more info and a download link, see the wiki linked below!"

		"For the longest time, my way to organize photos was a mostly unreliable bash script that would often result in lost files if date metadata, especially on videos, was missing. This new and improved timestamp tool was developed to fix all reliability issues, improve speed, and add some customizability. In short, I wanted to make something that would be useful for others too.\\n\\nThe new and improved timestamp tool allows you to rename EXIF and XMP files to reflect date found in metadata. The specific tag used to extract data from the file can be changed, as can the final date format used in the file rename. And, to make it easier for others to discover, I've published it to the Arch Linux AUR!"

		"Cursed Table Revamped is another Minecraft Mod, though quite a bit smaller than Endshards. In the unmodified game, treasure and curse enchantments do not appear in the Enchanting Table at all.\\n\\nWith Cursed Table Revamped, by default, curses are added to the list of possible enchants. For me, that wasn't quite enough though, so I added a few custom game rules that allow the player to pick and choose exactly which enchants can appear."

Through the use of C++ preprocessor directives, it's possible to change how many instructions are fetched, executed, and removed from the queue each 'clock cycle.'"

The idea of the game is a 2D tile-based adventure/exploration game with NPCs and quests. Currently, the game is able to randomly generate a world with cities based on a given seed, and test that the pathing and generation algorithms work properly. For now, the game is on pause because Endshards is more exciting to work on."

In the end, I learnt a lot about the history of this bus, but the mystery remains unsolved..."

Additionally, more lights on the back of the jacket light up automatically in low-light conditions, triggered by a photoresistor."
